## Executive Summary/Abstract:
In the modern world it’s essential to keep our body healthy. One of the most important to be kept regularly is dietary. According to the Liverpool John Moores University one of the keys to healthiness is to maintain the mass of the body relative to its height. This is called ideal weight. Any person who has more or less than ideal weight tends to have illnesses like for overweight people: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and associated risk factors e.g. high cholesterol, high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes, Psychological e.g. depression, low self esteem, Musculoskeletal problems (e.g. knee, ankle and foot pain), Cancer, Behavioural problems, and for underweight people: Poor growth, Increases risk of osteoporosis, Less likely to be fit and active (increases cardiovascular risk), Weaker immune system (increases likelihood of illnesses). These are triggering our motivation to make an application that is readily used by people who need help in maintaining their body relying on accurate information by the state of the art of our information technology. On the other hand we also add some features for people that have a purpose to keep what they eat healthy.

Our app has two types of inputs. First is the name of the food and second is the ingredients of the food. The two inputs are fed into our machine learning models to output a solution and report for users.
